# WAISYGH

**WAISYGH** stands for "What an incredible story you've got here!". It's a web application that allows anyone to share their stories.

### To make it work on local
First, you need to get all the node modules :
```shell
$ npm i
```
Then, you need to run two shell commands, the first one to build then watch the front repository `/client`, the second to launch the local server (you will need two different terminal to launch those commands) :
```shell
$ npm run front-watch
```
```shell
$ gulp serve
```
